- A _single perceptron_ (or **neuron**) can be imagined as a Logistic Regression. **Artificial Neural Network**, or **ANN**, is a group of multiple perceptrons/ neurons at each layer. **ANN** is also known as a **Feed-Forward Neural network** because inputs are processed only in the forward direction.
