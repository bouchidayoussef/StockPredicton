- Over the years, various machine learning techniques have been used in **stock market prediction**, but with the increased amount of **data** and expectation of **more accurate prediction**, the deep learning models are being used nowadays which have proven their advantage over traditional machine learning methods in terms of accuracy and speed of prediction. In this article, we will discuss the **Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) _Recurrent Neural Network_** :brain:, one of the **_popular_** deep learning models, used in stock market prediction. In this project, we will fetch the historical and **live data** of stock **automatically** using __python libraries__ and fit the __LSTM model__ on this data to **predict** the future prices of the stock.
